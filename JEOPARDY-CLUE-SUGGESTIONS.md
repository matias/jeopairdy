## Categories and Game Board

- **Balance the Board:** A typical game board has six categories. Aim for a mix of subjects, such as academic topics, pop culture, wordplay, and general knowledge, to appeal to a wide audience.
- **Create Five Clues Per Category:** Each category should have five clues, with dollar values that correspond to increasing difficulty levels (e.g., $200 for the easiest, $1,000 for the hardest).
- **Use Punny or Descriptive Titles:** Categories often have clever, pun-filled titles (e.g., "Potent Potables") or are straightforward descriptions of the subject.

## Clue Writing

- **Phrase Clues as Answers:** The clues should be factual statements or descriptions, not questions. The correct response must be in the form of a question.
- **Ensure a Single Correct Response:** Each clue must have only one definitive correct response. Avoid ambiguity by being specific in the wording. For example, instead of asking for the "second largest" of a group, specify whether you mean by volume or surface area.
- **Vary Difficulty:** Clues should provide enough information for a player to reason out the answer, but not so much that the answer is obvious. The difficulty should increase with the dollar value.
- **Prioritize Accuracy:** Every fact within a clue must be correct and verifiable.
- **Keep it Concise:** Clues are generally short and to the point.
